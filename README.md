The [Database I](https://github.com/rsmwall/ifpi-ads-course/tree/main/ads-2023.2/banco-dados-i) discipline provided the basis of the content, starting from Entity-Relationship Diagram, Relational Algebra to SQL bases using PostgreSQL.

### Software Engineering I

In [Software Engineering I](https://github.com/rsmwall/ifpi-ads-course/tree/main/ads-2023.2/engenharia-software-i), we saw the basic concepts of software engineering such as development methodologies, SCRUM and XP.

This [Object-Oriented Programming](https://github.com/rsmwall/ifpi-ads-course/tree/main/ads-2023.2/programacao-orientada-objetos), the bases of the TypeScript language were seen, as well as the bases of OOP, extending to methods, classes, abstract classes, exceptions and interfaces. This content is divided between room codes, exercises and assessments. With emphasis on [Rede Social](https://github.com/rsmwall/ifpi-ads-course/tree/main/ads-2023.2/programacao-orientada-objetos/avaliacoes/rede-social), a simple social network program for terminals.

### Operating Systems

In [Operating Systems](https://github.com/rsmwall/ifpi-ads-course/tree/main/ads-2023.2/sistemas-operacionais), the bases of the systems were shown, such as processes, scheduling, process communication and coordination, banker's algorithm, deadlocks and memory management. Here are the two books used in the discipline, namely: Machado Maia and Maziero. As well as assessments, challenges such as Round Robin and Banker's Algorithm made in C++ and about Threads and System Calls in Ruby.
